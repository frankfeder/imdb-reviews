       "\"So this is it. Interestingly enough, this is also the only movie-related work by Eadweard Muybridge. I'm truly curious how people perceived and reacted to these 3 seconds back in the 1880s.Muybridge certainly made a good choice for picking this subject, a majestic horse and its rider with a strong contrast in color between his shirt and his breeches. Surely a smart move to use the animal's hooves as the trigger for making the shots. If you take a close enough look you can see the numbers of the photographs he used in the bottom left. What I also liked about it is all the different shadows and shades altering constantly. It must have been a unique experience to see something in motion that, at the point of time when they saw it, was already long gone.\""
