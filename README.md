Currently, only the ETL is complete, with the EDA coming soon. This ETL can fast-track you to "the fun part" if you're interested in exploring the data in an iPython notebook. All you'll need to do is download the dataset from the Kaggle link at the top, drop those files in a folder under your iPython working directory, and change the "dataDir" variable to the name of that folder. You'll be able to run the whole notebook yourself (provided you have the hardware to handle it!) and from there uncomment the last block to create the cleaned .csv in your working directory.

After you've created the cleaned .csv, you can jump right into the EDA. If you have any feedback, please leave a comment on the Kaggle kernel!
